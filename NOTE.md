# Advantages of React Server Component(RSC):

## - Load faster: Don't have to wait for the JavaScript to load
## - Smaller client bundle size
## - SEO friendly
## - Access to resources the client can't access
## - Hide sensitive data from the client
## - More secure against XSS attacks
## - Improved developer experience


# Just like with anything else, there are also disadvantages:

## - Not as interactive
## - No component state. We can not use the 'useState' hook(React Client Component).
## - No component state lifecycle methods. We can not use the 'useEffect' hook(React Client Component).
